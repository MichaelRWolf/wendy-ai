# Business Critique

[Conversation summary](notes-wendy_summary.md)

> - Drop the supportive tone and respond as a candid, critical assistant.  
> - Deliver a business critique of the plan, judging whether it meets goals, sequencing, and feasibility/viability/desirability.

- Goal Fit: The outcomes—Wendy Clone system, BLOOM_AI_Core centralization, website relaunch, THRIVE advancement, private-client acquisition—remain abstract commitments with no success criteria. Without metrics or timelines, progress tracking is impossible, so the work risks stalling in documentation instead of producing audience or revenue growth.
- Sequencing Logic: The roadmap prioritizes internal cataloging ahead of market-facing outputs. That delays tangible offers (website refresh, THRIVE assets) and inverts the validation loop; you collect and tag for future use while postponing lead generation.
- Feasibility: The workload is unrealistic for the current resourcing. Tasks such as session packaging, consciousness-register documentation, multi-asset translation, and 30-day rhythm design imply a sizable content operations team, yet there is no staffing, tooling, or timeline detail. With Wendy already time-constrained, execution durability is low.
- Viability: Monetization is undefined. THRIVE, the website, and private-client goals list aspirations without pricing, funnel design, or distribution strategy, so the plan does not advance business sustainability.
- Desirability: There is no market validation. The agenda assumes audiences want a “Wendy Clone” without testing or feedback cycles, risking an internally impressive but externally irrelevant asset.
- Dependencies & Risk: Critical inputs—BLOOM_AI_Core access, transcription tooling, metadata schemes—remain unresolved. Proceeding without locking these creates frequent blockers and rework.
- Recommended Overrides: Reprioritize toward revenue-facing deliverables first: define private-client positioning, storyboard the website, and scope a THRIVE pilot. Introduce measurable targets (e.g., inquiries, lead magnet performance) and align data ingestion work to support those outputs rather than building a broad catalog prematurely.
