# Role Critiques

## Knowledge Architect / AI Workflow Lead

### Key Work (Knowledge Architect)

- Maintain the 30-day “Wendy Clone” rhythm and ensure each cycle advances the knowledge base.
- Translate conversation insights into structured workflows and checkpoints inside `BLOOM_AI_Core`.
- Partner with domain leads to prioritize which materials get distilled next and how outputs feed website, THRIVE, and client needs.

### Critical Review (Knowledge Architect)

- Risk of over-designing cadence and templates before downstream teams confirm they can actually execute; could create bottlenecks.
- Needs a tighter feedback loop with revenue owners so the rhythm emphasizes what’s launch-critical, not just what’s documentable.
- Should define measurable completion criteria per cycle; otherwise, efforts may feel circular or perpetual.

### Supportive Review (Knowledge Architect)

- Establishes a calming, repeatable heartbeat that shields the team from reactive scramble.
- Keeps vision connected across tracks (knowledge, marketing, automation) so work products stay coherent.
- Acts as translator between spiritual framework and technical scaffolding, protecting authenticity while enabling scale.

## Content Librarian / Metadata Specialist

### Key Work (Content Librarian)

- Centralize canonical materials, apply consciousness-register tags, and maintain folder taxonomy (`00`–`70` series).
- Vet new uploads for metadata completeness (source links, timestamps, register, tone) before they enter the corpus.
- Document package templates so future contributors replicate structure without hand-holding.

### Critical Review (Content Librarian)

- Over-reliance on manual tagging could slow ingestion; needs a plan for batch tooling or delegated QA.
- Current metadata schema may be too abstract for collaborators; should produce quick-start guides and samples.
- Must align with marketing/automation teams to avoid information deserts where critical assets stay “hidden” in draft.

### Supportive Review (Content Librarian)

- Provides searchable, trustworthy single source of truth, saving everyone from spelunking old docs.
- Metadata discipline enables the consciousness-register strategy to survive beyond the founding team.
- Sets standards that make downstream automation vastly easier because inputs remain consistent.

## Transcript Production & Packaging Lead

### Key Work (Transcript Lead)

- Receive raw recordings or transcripts, clean out non-dialogue content, and label speakers accurately.
- Generate the three-file bundle (full transcript, Wendy-only extract, dual summary) for each session.
- Capture source metadata (YouTube URL, timestamps) and deliver packages to `70_Video_Audio` and `00_Voice_Identity`.

### Critical Review (Transcript Lead)

- Needs SOPs for partial transcripts and multi-part episodes to avoid queue stalls when automation isn’t ready.
- Should push for quality checks on speaker identification—errors here cascade into voice training problems.
- Lacks clarity on turnaround expectations; without SLAs, other teams can’t plan publication schedules.

### Supportive Review (Transcript Lead)

- Converts long-form recordings into immediately usable assets for voice training, marketing, and archives.
- Builds repeatable packaging muscle that future contractors or tools can slot into.
- Acts as the guardrail protecting Wendy’s voice integrity while honoring collaborators like Susana.

## Website & UX Copy Strategist

### Key Work (Website Strategist)

- Transform AI Clone outputs into visitor-ready copy (doorways, program pages, exploratory paths).
- Ensure site architecture invites multiple consciousness registers without overwhelming new visitors.
- Coordinate with THRIVE and private-client funnels so messaging stays consistent from page to offer.

### Critical Review (Website Strategist)

- Needs concrete segmentation data before tailoring copy—risk of speaking to everyone and resonating with no one.
- Requires alignment with design/UX resources; otherwise copy may live in slides instead of shipping.
- Must secure rapid feedback loops (user testing, analytics) to validate that the “gentle container” is performing.

### Supportive Review (Website Strategist)

- Bridges the internal knowledge base with public storytelling, accelerating website relaunch goals.
- Captures Wendy’s voice in digital form, preserving authenticity while clarifying offers.
- Helps surface THRIVE and private-client pathways early, translating spiritual language into actionable invites.

## Program Marketing & THRIVE Campaign Lead

### Key Work (Marketing Lead)

- Convert distilled insights into campaigns that enroll THRIVE cohorts and private clients.
- Run small revenue experiments (emails, pilots, salons) and measure response before scaling.
- Feed learnings back into the knowledge base to refine scripts, objections, and testimonials.

### Critical Review (Marketing Lead)

- Must avoid collecting insights without closing loops on actual enrollments; success metric is revenue, not content volume.
- Needs synchronized calendar with transcript/website teams to launch assets in tandem; otherwise momentum stalls.
- Should document regulatory or ethical guardrails for sensitive audiences to prevent messaging missteps.

### Supportive Review (Marketing Lead)

- Keeps the project grounded in financial sustainability, ensuring AI efforts fuel real-world impact.
- Offers rapid validation cycles that help prioritize which frameworks deserve more automation investment.
- Amplifies Wendy’s compassion-driven mission in formats that invite immediate participation.

## Automation & Tooling Engineer

### Key Work (Automation Engineer)

- Evaluate manual vs. automated transcript processing, design hybrid pipelines with light scripting.
- Maintain reusable template generators (session packages, metadata headers) with source links intact.
- Support other roles by integrating tools (transcription services, storage, tagging helpers) without overwhelming the team.

### Critical Review (Automation Engineer)

- Danger of chasing shiny tooling instead of solving today’s bottlenecks; must stay anchored to scoped use cases.
- Needs explicit security/privacy posture before introducing new services handling sensitive conversations.
- Should prepare debriefs that teach non-technical teammates how to operate or troubleshoot the tools.

### Supportive Review (Automation Engineer)

- Frees high-value contributors from repetitive tasks, letting them focus on creativity and client work.
- Enables phased automation, matching the project’s rhythm and protecting the team from tool fatigue.
- Builds the technical foundation Michael can extend later without rewriting the entire pipeline.
