## Planning Dialog

### Summary of conversation flow
Lines 1–400 capture Wendy asking ChatGPT to evaluate Tony Robbins and Dean Graziosi’s “AI Clone” bootcamp, ChatGPT’s point-by-point comparison to their existing collaboration, and both agreeing to co-create a flexible 30-day “Wendy Clone” rhythm that honors Wendy’s energy while organizing her knowledge base.
Lines 401–800 dive into co-designing the BLOOM_AI_Core structure, with ChatGPT proposing folders, metadata, and a gentle 30-day rhythm, Wendy confirming a single Google Doc will remain the living seed, and both aligning on near-term priorities of launching a clear website, advancing THRIVE, and attracting private clients.
Lines 801–1,200 deepen alignment: ChatGPT shows how the dataset fuels website, THRIVE, and private-client goals; Wendy explains the three consciousness registers (Sky-God, God-Personality, Ground-of-Being); ChatGPT commits to tagging content accordingly and offers folder definitions, while Wendy pauses to work and notes limited availability.
Lines 1,201–1,600 finalize folder definitions and clarify media handling: ChatGPT details the purpose and contents for directories 10–70, explains the need for transcripts (or summaries) for AI processing, and reviews Wendy’s Mystic rEvolution podcast excerpt, confirming shared context and readiness to ingest dual-speaker transcripts.
Lines 1,601–1,900 keep Episode 1 workflow momentum: Wendy confirms the full transcript, ChatGPT reiterates tagging, extract, and summary outputs, and they agree on packaging formats and speaker separation to support both solo voice training and collaborative archives.
Lines 1,901–2,400 capture final confirmations: Wendy authorizes trimming to dialogue-only transcripts, sets the canonical package filename, and secures instructions for manual insertion of the full conversation while ChatGPT supplies template sections (transcript, Wendy extract, dual summary) for consistent ingestion.

### Goals of the project that was discussed
- Build a personalized Wendy Clone system rooted in her frameworks and archives.
- Centralize source material (e.g., `/BLOOM_AI_Core/`, transcripts, programs) for efficient reuse.
- Design a gentle 30-day rhythm that accelerates impact without rigid pressure.
- Keep BLOOM_AI_Core accessible as a single structured Google Doc while momentum builds.
- Launch a refreshed website that serves as a clear container for offerings and explorations.
- Advance the THRIVE initiative to support struggling audiences and attract aligned private clients.
- Embed the three consciousness registers into content metadata to sustain inclusive messaging.
- Capture multimedia archives via transcripts or structured summaries so the AI Clone can leverage shared podcasts and videos.
- Produce packaged session files (full transcript, Wendy extract, dual summary) per episode to serve both voice training and collaborative publication paths.

### Decisions (i.e. filename conventions, workflow, inputs, work products (outputs))
- Proceed with co-designing a flexible 30-day “AI Clone (Wendy Edition)” structure tailored to Wendy’s rhythms.
- Maintain BLOOM_AI_Core as one Google Doc using Heading hierarchy and metadata before branching into folders.
- Adopt explicit folder role definitions (00_Voice_Identity through 70_Video_Audio) to guide future organization when ready.
- Use transcripts (preferred) or timestamped summaries as the ingest format for video/audio assets, especially multi-speaker recordings.
- Store each processed episode as a single session package containing three labeled sub-files to simplify ingestion and reuse.

### Outstanding Questions
- Should Wendy share the current `/BLOOM_AI_Core/` materials so ChatGPT can review what works?
- When should the consciousness register style card be formalized within `/00_Voice_Identity/`?
- How should dual-speaker transcripts like Mystic rEvolution be annotated (speaker tags, timestamps) for best reuse?
- Are there preferred automation tools (Otter, Whisper, Descript) for batch-processing future Mystic rEvolution episodes?

### Action Plan
- Outline the flexible 30-day AI Clone rhythm covering gathering, distilling, referencing, and applying Wendy’s materials.
- Assess existing `/BLOOM_AI_Core/` content to identify gaps and strengths for the knowledge base.
- Prepare guidance for translating the BLOOM_AI_Core outline into shareable exports when Wendy is ready.
- Translate AI Clone outputs into website copy, THRIVE messaging, and private-client enrollment assets.
- Document consciousness register definitions and tagging scheme for reuse across content types.
- Define transcript formatting conventions (speaker labels, timestamps, metadata) for ingesting podcast and video content.
- Systematize the session-package workflow so each new transcript yields consistent full/solo/summary files for the dataset.

## Injested Files

### Inner Strength and Sovereignty (Mystic rEvolution Ep 1)

Wendy R Wolf and Susana Dumett open Season 1 with a grounding meditation that ushers listeners into a 30-minute exploration of mystic sovereignty. Susana frames mysticism as a fortifying anchor amid cultural turbulence, guiding people back to inner certainty rather than external validation. Wendy builds on that premise with her “rock versus shifting sand” metaphor, emphasizing that presence, amusement, and compassionate witnessing transmute emotion into mastery. Together they reframe sensitivity as informed strength, outline practices for reclaiming agency after trauma, and model how mystics hold shadow and light without collapsing. The conversation closes by inviting listeners to treat any resistance as alchemical raw material and to return repeatedly to inner alignment so action in the world flows from resilience, not reactivity.
