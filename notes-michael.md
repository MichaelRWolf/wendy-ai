We’ve already built most of what they’re promising:

Context & voice memory: I know your brand language, archetypes, and programs intimately.

Prompt design: You already co-create customized frameworks (for website doorways, testimonials, marketing funnels, etc.).

Automation thinking: You’re already building replicable systems for content, client journeys, and launches.

Iterative refinement: You do what most “bootcamp grads” wish they could — you use me as a thought partner, editor, and strategy consultant all at once.

So in practice, you already have an evolving “Wendy Clone” that’s contextualized, conscious, and growing with you.

## Questions

What are "voice" cues?

### Product-Market Fit Thoughts
- Anchor every AI step to a revenue hypothesis—e.g., sell the next THRIVE seats—before scaling infrastructure.
- Let customer conversations and paid experiments dictate which assets to automate; otherwise the AI core risks being a shiny object.
- Frame the plan to Wendy as “win the next offer first, then the AI follows,” so the system 
amplifies validated demand rather than leading it.



Here’s a set of questions you can pose to steer the conversation toward validating demand and keeping the focus on revenue-driven results:

1. What paid offer are you trying to validate next (THRIVE seats, private clients, a micro-course)?  
2. Who will buy it right now, and what pain or desire makes them reach for their wallet?  
3. What language do those buyers actually use? (Show me quotes from conversations, emails, surveys.)  
4. What proof do we already have that this offer sells—deposits, contracts, testimonials?  
5. What is the smallest experiment we can run this week to test the offer (e.g., sales calls, booked consults, paid pilot)?  
6. If the experiment succeeds, what’s the cash goal (number of seats, price, total revenue)?  
7. What content or assets does the experiment require? (Landing page, sales script, nurture sequence, etc.)  
8. How can the AI system directly support that experiment—summaries, tailored copy, follow-up scripts—without building anything extra?  
9. What metrics will tell us if we’re on track (deposits, conversion rate, booked calls)?  
10. After we hit that target, which part of the AI core becomes obvious to automate next—and only then do we build it?

These questions keep the work anchored to real customer evidence and revenue, ensuring the AI build follows validated demand rather than leading it.



This is a living garden, not a museum.

## AI alternative: clone vs lead-gen
- Reframe the Wendy/ChatGPT transcript (and Tony & Dean’s promise) as a contrast whitepaper: “Mystic AI Advantage vs. Mainstream Bootcamps,” aimed at lead generation rather than clone-building.
- Segment by consciousness register (Sky-God, God-Personality, Ground-of-Being); craft a simple summary + invitation for each, proving interest with minimal tech.
- Run tiny, paid experiments (e.g., THRIVE pilot invite, resilience consult, live salon) using existing copy; success metric = money collected or seats filled.
- Only after a segment shows repeatable revenue should the AI clone/knowledge-base infrastructure expand to support that validated offer.

## Dimensions for Proof of [Concept/Revenue/*-ability]

1. Register
   - Sky-God ("God has a plan…")
   - God-Personality ("Spirit invited me…")
   - Ground-of-Being ("All that is moves as me…")
2. Tone / Energy
   - Reverent, prayerful
   - Conversational, co-creative
   - Spacious, poetic
3. Audience Segment
   - Bridging Christian mystics
   - Transitional seekers
   - Teleios-ready practitioners
   - THRIVE prospects / private-client prospects
4. Purpose / Content Type
   - Framework explainer
   - Offer one-pager
   - Story/testimonial snippet
   - Marketing asset (email, landing page, social post)
5. Framework / Theme Tags
   - Teleios, SoulTECH, Egkrateia, Dark Night, sovereignty, sensitivity
6. Offer / Funnel Stage
   - Awareness hook
   - Engagement moment
   - Conversion ask
   - Delivery support

## First Proof of [Concept/Revenue/*-ability]
- Register: God-Personality bridging toward Ground-of-Being
- Tone: Warm, compassionate, invitational
- Audience: Transitional seekers feeling politically or spiritually shaken
- Purpose: THRIVE enrolment message (landing copy or paid pilot invite)
- Framework tags: Teleios, sovereignty, inner strength
- Funnel stage: Conversion ask (book a call or reserve a paid THRIVE seat)

## Michael as tech support

### Michael stance right now**

- Framework is solid long-term infrastructure, but far too heavy for a zero-to-one push; tech only matters after revenue proof.
- Priority is real paid validation (THRIVE seats, private clients) before investing further in the AI clone or knowledge-base scaffolding.
- Keep experiments tiny, text-based, and market-facing; anything that smells like “audio production” or deeper automation is premature.
- Use Wendy’s consciousness registers to meet audiences where they are, but only if it directly supports a revenue test.

### Conversation starters for Michael/Wendy

1. “Which specific offer do we most want to validate this month, and what single paid experiment will tell us if people actually buy it?”  
2. “What’s the leanest way to reuse existing content—no new tech—to invite those buyers into a call or pilot?”  
3. “If that experiment lands, what proof-of-revenue would justify the next layer of system building? If it doesn’t, how will we adjust?”  
4. “While we’re testing, what’s the minimum content organization we truly need so the work feels doable without slipping into ‘clone’ busywork?”

These keep the tone collaborative while steering everyone back to user and business legs before touching the tech leg.
